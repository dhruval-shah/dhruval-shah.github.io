  <h2>Tile-Matching Game</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3> 
<p><font size = "2">This is a popular tile-matching game, implemented using a Python GUI toolkit called 'TKinter'. The objective of the game is to have the player match all the tiles by relying on their memory. There are 6 level progressions in this game, although the coding style can allow for a rapid implementation of further levels. The player is timed and scored on how quickly they can solve the puzzle. The following video gives a demonstration of the game. The link to the source code can be found <a href = "https://github.com/dhruval-shah/Tile-Matching-Game/blob/master/Memory_Game_Extended.py">here.</a> The full version of the game can be downloaded <a href = "https://github.com/dhruval-shah/dhruval-shah.github.io/blob/main/Memory_Game_Extended.zip">here.</a></font></p>

  <h2>Radio Receiver Project</h2>
  <p><font size = "2">In a team of 4 engineers, we constructed a low power, AM Radio Receiver that is capable of tuning into several AM Broadcast Band (BCB) stations in Vancouver, BC. We made several altercations to the basic circuit that allowed us to make improvements in the following categories: selectivity, sensitivity, and distortion. The basic circuit is as follows:</font></p>

  <h2>The SunFinder (Line Following Robot)</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>

 <p><font size = "2">As a part of a design course, we were required to create an autonomous robot (which we named 'The SunFinder') under time and budget constraints. The objective of the robot was to navigate a pre-determined grid, marked by black tape, and dispose waste materials inside previously selected bins that were located at the edges of the grid. My primary focus was on designing and implementing the navigation and bin detection software.</font></p>

  <h3>Software Implementation</h3>
 
  <p>
  <font size = "2">
  The software for this robot was implemented using an Arduino Uno Microcontroller and a variety of sensors; for the purpose of grid navigation and bin detection, I used a SunFounder IIC IR Line Following Module and an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor (shown below from left to right)
